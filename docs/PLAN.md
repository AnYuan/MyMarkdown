# Implementation Plan: High-Performance Markdown Renderer

## Executive Summary
This document breaks down the execution strategy to fulfill the requirements defined in the PRD. The objective is to build a high-performance, ChatGPT-aligned Markdown renderer for iOS 17.0+ and macOS 26.0+ via Swift 6.0+. The architecture emphasizes background layout calculation, extensive syntactical support (including LaTeX math), and an extensible AST middleware.

## Phase 1: Core Parsing Engine
**Goal**: Integrate `swift-markdown` and construct our proprietary, thread-safe Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) models.
1. Initialize the Swift Package inside the `MarkdownKit` workspace and import Apple's `swift-markdown`.
2. Create internal AST node structures (e.g., `DocumentNode`, `ParagraphNode`, `ImageNode`, `CodeBlockNode`, `MathNode`).
3. Implement a `MarkupVisitor` to parse the `cmark-gfm` output strictly into our internal thread-safe models.
4. Establish the AST Middleware/Plugin system allowing arbitrary manipulation of nodes before moving to the rendering phase.
5. **Quality Assurance**: Write 100% test coverage unit tests proving parsing fidelity against both CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) specs.

## Phase 2: Asynchronous Layout Engine (Texture-Inspired)
**Goal**: Design the layout calculation engine that operates off the main thread to guarantee O(1) rendering time relative to file size.
1. Define `LayoutResult` models containing exact core graphics `{x, y, width, height}` coordinate geometries and drawing contexts.
2. Build the Layout Engine using `TextKit 2` bounding-box solvers running entirely inside a GCD background queue.
3. Implement a chunking and yielding mechanism to ensure parsing and sizing massive documents do not spike memory unpredictably.
4. **Quality Assurance**: Develop unit tests verifying mathematically perfect framing calculations for varying device screen widths and dynamic type sizes.

## Phase 3: Virtualized Rendering UI
**Goal**: Only instantiate UI layers when components enter the viewport, and completely eliminate main-thread blocking during rendering.
1. **iOS**: Implement a high-performance `UICollectionView` handling virtualization.
2. **macOS**: Implement the `NSTableView`/`NSCollectionView` AppKit equivalents.
3. Develop individual native View components for each layout node (e.g., `MarkdownTextView`, `MarkdownImageView`, `MarkdownCodeView`).
4. **Texture Display State**: Specifically mandate that all text rendering (drawing `NSAttributedString` to a `CGContext`) and all `Image/GIF` data decoding must occur strictly on a background queue.
5. Implement the asynchronous mounting logic—applying the pre-drawn contexts to views dynamically as the user scrolls.
6. **Quality Assurance**: Perform memory profiling confirming the footprint remains under 100MB even for millions of words.

## Phase 4: Extended Syntax & Rich Elements
**Goal**: Perfect alignment with the ChatGPT App feature sets.
1. **Rich Code Blocks**: Integrate a high-speed syntax highlighter (like Splash or similar native tool). Attach a native "Copy Code" button and language indicator overhead.
2. **Complex Math & Equations**: Integrate robust LaTeX bridging (e.g., KaTeX/MathJax via lightweight WKWebView injection, or native equation parsers like iosMath/SwiftMath if capable of complex macros).
3. **Theming Engine**: Build the unified Typography and Color token system supporting Day/Night mode automatically.
4. **Quality Assurance**: Write extensive automated UI Layout tests ensuring LaTeX blocks and highlighted code size properly without horizontal truncation.

## Phase 5: Delivery & Refinement
**Goal**: Finalize stability and code hygiene.
1. Thoroughly execute the Self-Improvement Loop defined in `GEMINI.md`.
2. Clean up memory leaks or performance hitches found during rigorous stress testing.
3. **Quality Assurance**: Snapshot tests for the final render output ensuring complete visual parity with the expected ChatGPT-app visual designs.
