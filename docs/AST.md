# AST Parsing Engine

## Overview
The `MyMarkdown` AST parsing engine serves as a bridge between the core Apple `swift-markdown` library (which wraps `cmark-gfm`) and our optimized asynchronous layout engine.

## `MarkdownNode`
Every visible block or inline element parsed from a markdown string is converted into a structurally safe `MarkdownNode`.
This conversion is crucial because raw `swift-markdown` trees are built over C pointers which can be thread-unsafe and slow to iterate during high-frequency scrolling.

By mapping them into native Swift structs (`DocumentNode`, `ParagraphNode`, `HeaderNode`, etc.), we unlock the ability to offload all heavy text calculation (`TextKit 2` rendering) entirely onto background queues.

## `MyMarkdownVisitor`
The `MyMarkdownVisitor` class adopts the `MarkupVisitor` protocol. It traverses the tree generated by `swift-markdown` and spits out an array of initialized `MarkdownNode` objects.

### Supported Basic Nodes
- **Document**: The root container.
- **Header**: `# H1` evaluated into `HeaderNode`.
- **Paragraph**: Standard lines of text.
- **Text**: The baseline `TextNode` string primitives.
