# Rendering Pipeline Sequence

This sequence shows the end-to-end flow from markdown input to on-screen virtualized rendering.

    else Code block

        CodeView->>TextView: configure(inset layout)
    else Image node
        Cell->>ImageView: configure(layout)
        ImageView->>ImageView: download/decode/downsample in background
        ImageView-->>Cell: layer.contents update on MainActor
    end
```

## Notes

- Sizing is expected to be O(1) at collection-view query time because dimensions are precomputed.
- Heavy work is intentionally shifted to background tasks, with only final layer/content mounting on main thread.
- Theme/appearance changes should trigger layout refresh so cached attributed output matches current colors.
